# Bubble Sort

An implementation of a bubble sort in C. 

The program reads in multiple one dimensional int arrays from a file named input.txt, one array at a time. The program then prints a copy of each array both unsorted and sorted to a file named output.txt.

The format of the input.txt file:

> n_rows
> unsorted_array
> unsorted_array
> unsorted_array
> unsorted_array
> ...

All values in the unsorted arrays are separated by spaces.

The format of the output.txt file:

> n*2_rows
> unsorted_array_a
> sorted_array_a
> unsorted_array_b
> sorted_array_b
> ...

All values in the sorted arrays are separated by spaces.

*The .ods file is a spreadsheet which can be opened with LibreOffice Calc, containing the unsorted and sorted arrays. The rows highlighted in yellow are arrays which I cross checked with it's sorted counterpart.*
